**** TEMPLATE STRINGS ****

The Template Literal, introduced in ES6, is a new way to create a string. 
With it comes new features that allow us more control over dynamic strings 
in our programs. Gone will be the days of long string concatenation!

To create a template literal, instead of single quotes (') or double quotes (") quotes 
we use the backtick (`) character. 
This will produce a new string, and we can use it in any way we want.

Basic usage:

let newString = `A string`;

Multi-line

    let myMultiString= `This will be
    on two lines!`;

Expressions

    let name = `Ryan`;
    console.log(`Hi my name is ${name}`);
