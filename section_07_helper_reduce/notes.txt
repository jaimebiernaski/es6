**** HELPER - reduce ****

The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element 
of t
he array, resulting in a single output value.

The reducer function takes four arguments:

Accumulator (acc)
Current Value (cur)
Current Index (idx)
Source Array (src)

Your reducer function's returned value is assigned to the accumulator, 
whose value is remembered across each iteration throughout the array, 
and ultimately becomes the final, single resulting value.

Syntax

    arr.reduce(callback( accumulator, currentValue[, index[, array]] )[, initialValue])

Parameters

    callback
        A function to execute on each element in the array 
        (except for the first, if no initialValue is supplied).

        It takes four arguments:

            accumulator
                The accumulator accumulates callback's return values. 
                It is the accumulated value previously returned in the last 
                invocation of the callbackâ€”or initialValue, if it was supplied 
                (see below).
            
            currentValue
                The current element being processed in the array.
            
            index Optional
                The index of the current element being processed in the array. 
                Starts from index 0 if an initialValue is provided. 
                Otherwise, it starts from index 1.

            array Optional
                The array reduce() was called upon.

initialValue Optional
    A value to use as the first argument to the first call of the callback. 
    If no initialValue is supplied, the first element in the array will be used 
    as the initial accumulator value and skipped as currentValue. 
    Calling reduce() on an empty array without an initialValue will throw a TypeError.

Return value
    The single value that results from the reduction.
